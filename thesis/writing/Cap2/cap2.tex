\section{General Objective}
The main objective of the study is to design a computational tool for optimization of preliminary design of axial flow turbines with focus on turbopump usage. Project aims to use a reduced order methodology on turbine physics and genetic algorithm to handle the optimization process.

The process to find the optimal solution will be guided by maximizing the pressure ratio through turbine stage and also maximizing the overall efficiency in the operational envelope of the axial flow turbine.  

\section{Theme Identification}

\section{Contribution of the Present Work}
This computer-aided engineering software aimed to be developed in this work has already been developed by other companies and countries. However, as this theme has strategical and state sovereignty characteristics due to the multidisciplinary techonoligical dependencies, either this tool is restrictly available to be used in foreign countries were it was developed, either they are very expensive.

That stated, this tool has great potential to bring benefits to governamental organizations as Brazilian Air Force (FAB) and to companies and groups of the Defense Industrial Base (BID) of Brazil.
